# Weather-App
App that allows you to know the temperature in every city in the world.
Instructions: When specifying an american city use both State (EX: GEORGIA,CALIFORNIA,ALABAMA) indicators after city name and also country (United States,Venezuela,Italy,Russia).
So for example Rome,Georgia,United States would give you the city of Rome in the state of Georgia while Rome,United States would give you Rome in the state of New York and just "Rome" would give you Rome italy.
